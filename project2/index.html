        <h4>
          Figure 1: Substantiated misconduct cases rose after body cameras
          became common, suggesting increased accountability.
        </h4>

        <h4>Design Decisions and Rationale</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cherry picking timeframes: I only showed 2009–2010 and 2019–2020,
            skipping the years in between to make the jump look cleaner and more
            dramatic. By hiding those middle years, the increase seems steady
            and significant, even if the real trend isn’t. I did this to tell a
            simple “before vs. after” story that people can quickly understand.
            It makes the chart persuasive because the change looks clear and
            purposeful. It worked well visually, but it oversimplified the data.
            I first thought of including all years since that made the graph
            busier and less focused.
          </li>
          <li>
            Emphasizing percentage change (+11.2 pts):I used a big red arrow,
            bold font, and the label “+11.2 pts” to make the difference stand
            out. The bright color and large text pull attention to the increase
            and make it feel bigger and more important than it might be. I did
            this because people naturally focus on large, colorful numbers, and
            it makes the story easy to remember. It makes the chart persuasive
            because the change looks impressive and hard to ignore. It worked
            well for grabbing attention, but it leaves out important context
            like sample size or uncertainty. I first tried smaller text and
            neutral colors, but that made the visual lose its impact.
          </li>
          <li>
            Causal framing through title and layout:The title “Body Cameras Shed
            Light on Misconduct” and the upward arrow make it seem like body
            cameras directly caused the increase in substantiated complaints.
            The layout also reads like a story and pushes the idea of progress
            and improvement. I did this to make the chart feel more direct and
            convincing, since viewers can quickly connect cause and effect. It
            makes the message strong and easy to follow, but it also implies
            causation that the data doesn’t actually prove. I first thought of
            using a neutral title, but the causal one made the story more
            memorable and attention-grabbing.

        <h4>
          Figure 2: After body cam rollout, substantiated cases dropped while
          exonerations climbed, showing a shift in complaint outcomes.
        </h4>

        <h4>Design Decisions and Rationale</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Selective reference line:I added a dashed line labeled “Body Cam
            rollout begins (Apr 2017)” to make it look like that moment caused
            the shift in complaints. The line acts as a visual anchor, so people
            connect the trend change to that event. It made the story feel
            cleaner and more intentional, but it also hid that the trend started
            earlier. I thought about removing the line or adding more context,
            but leaving it made the message stronger and easier to understand in
            a quick view.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scale and normalization: I used raw counts instead of rates to make
            the changes look bigger and more dramatic. Showing totals
            exaggerates the movement between categories, even if the overall
            number of cases dropped. This helped the graph feel more impactful
            and aligned with the “shift” story. It worked visually, but it
            oversimplified the data. I considered using percentages, but it made
            the differences smaller and less convincing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Emotional color cues: I used red for “substantiated ↓” and green for
            “exonerated ↑” to trigger emotional reactions. People naturally see
            red as bad and green as good, so the colors helped tell the story
            without extra text. It made the chart more persuasive and memorable
            and it also created a bias. I tested softer colors but decided to
            keep the strong ones because they draw immediate attention and
            supported the narrative.

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <p class="placeholder">
          Working on both charts showed me how much power design choices have
          over how people read data. In the first chart, the “for” version, I
          only used two time periods (2009–2010 and 2019–2020) to make the rise
          in substantiated complaints look simple and dramatic. Skipping the
          years in between made the jump look clean, even though the real data
          had a lot more variation. I also highlighted “+11.2 pts” in bold red
          so it grabbed attention right away and made the change feel more
          important than it really was. It was easy to code in Python, but it
          was harder to decide what to show and what to hide. That part made me
          realize how easy it is to shape a story without ever technically
          lying. The second chart, the “against” version, showed the full data
          from 2005 to 2019, including Substantiated, Unsubstantiated, and
          Exonerated outcomes. I added a shaded area for 2017 to show when body
          cams rolled out, but that choice also pulled attention toward one
          specific point in time and made people connect that moment to the
          shift in trends. Color played a big role too, red made the
          “substantiated” line feel bad, and green made “exonerated” feel
          positive, even though those labels are neutral in reality. This
          version gave a clearer picture, but it was harder to keep clean and
          visually balanced without losing focus. I think ethical visualization
          is about being clear without being misleading. You can guide
          attention, but you shouldn’t bend the story or remove context just to
          make a point. The first chart crossed that line a bit because it hid
          too much, while the second one stayed fair even though it looked
          messier. What worked best was seeing how small details, like colors,
          titles, and scaling, completely change how someone interprets data.
          What didn’t work was how easily those same details can push people
          toward a biased takeaway. Now, whenever I look at a “nice” chart, I’ll
          try to ask what’s missing or why it looks that way, because sometimes
          what’s left out says more than what’s shown.
